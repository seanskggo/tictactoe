# game_dev

This repo contains all the actual app development files and dependencies.

Javascript/React Native

Futher installs required (npm modules for navigating between pages on app):

```npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack```

UI libraries to use later:

* Button design
 
 ```react-native-linear-gradient```
 
 * Game Engine
 
 ```react-native-game-engine```
 
 * Animations
 
 ```react-native-animatable```
 
 Additional Notes:
 
 * Use .svg files instead of .png etc (svg files do not lose resolution when resized and are smaller than png files)

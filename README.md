Notes:

* DO NOT PUSH DIRECTLY TO MASTER!!!! CREATE NEW BRANCH AND MERGE/PULL REQUEST PLZ!!!

* syntax for game proposal files are horrible: don't replicate!

* will change readme content before going public :D

Heyo andy, when naming branches, can you follow this convention:

```{feature/update/fix}-{your feature}-{your name}```
